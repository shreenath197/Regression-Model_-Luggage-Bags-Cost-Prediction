Regression Model_ Luggage Bags Cost Prediction

Observation & Explanation:-
---------------------------
1- All 4 regression models are performing similarly and has similar R^2 scores.
2- OLS method is performing little better and also taking lesser time than other models.
3- OLS and Normal Gradient descent have lesser RMSE and MSE than other two models.
4- From the Box Plot, outliers have been found for Length, Weight and weigh1 variables.
5- From the correlation heatmap, it is noticed that Length has more association with Cost or target
variable than other independent variables and
Length is inter correlated with Weight, Weight1, Width very strongly.
6- Hence, Length and Height have been taken as final model features to predict Cost.
